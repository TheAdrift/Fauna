The purpose of the document is to act as a pool for general notes, hypotheticals and queries into potential gameplay angles for Fauna. Because this is both and active an a historic repository, ideas that are rejected should not be deleted from the file, but marked with the [ unused ] tag, indicating that we've moved on from the idea. General idea being: if we get stumped, we can come back here, look at all the features we proposed and threw out.

Rougelike Gampeplay Hook - 2/26/2013
Idea here was that we approach the gameplay from a near rougelike perspective. This was dual purpose in design - first to make the game more implementeable and second to give the player clear input-output for how their actions were affecting the environment by actually synching the environment to the same clock the player moves on.

Team discussed this idea, and the consensus was that this would slow gameplay too much. We are wanting the player to be more active in the world - running, jumping, climbing trees etc. Idea was coupled with a few strategic aspects of gameplay that could potentially be repurposed for other gameplay styles.

Predator Behaviour: Territory Roaming/Marking - 2/26/2013
Idea here is that predators, as they roam about, mark their territory. As such, a player is in more danger of attracting a predator's attention if they are in this territory. This could be used both as a mechanic to cause menace to the player (requiring them to cross predator territory) and as a tool (luring other critters into predator territory) or as a strategic move (luring a predator to establish a territory to form a defensive perimiter).

Access Restriction based on Entity Type - 2/26/2013
Idea here is that in addition to basic territory types of [flora-controlled-territory | fungi-controlled-territory] there would also be an orthagonal type of territory that only certain types of entities could access. For example, tunnels, etc, that predators don't have access to, or control shafts that only the player can get at. This allows for the player to not have to be taking into account every single type of entity at every single second.

Room-by-Room Environment Management - 2/26/2013
Idea here is there is one room (the player-occupied room) that is 'active' at a given time. This allows the player to engage with the local wildlife in whatever way they choose, while the game keeps track of the metadata of the other rooms by crunching numbers. It is very likely we will use this idea, because otherwise the resources required to keep all rooms in 'active' state, and calculating the actions of all entities at all times will be prohibitive. 

There are some issues here that come to mind that we will need to think about. These issues include - 
  - The player will be able to move between rooms, but will the flora/fauna? If yes, then that can become quite complicated, because computer will have to keep track of not only populations within the rooms themselves, but will have to calculate traversals between all rooms. On the other hand, if they can't move between rooms, then each room becomes a miniature closed environment barring what the player brings in/out. Possibly this could be a major gameplay hook - running critters from room to room to preserve the peace? 
  - How to maintain a persistent feel to environment? If player leaves a room with all bunnies on northeast side, and then comes back into room and bunnies have been automatically repopulated on the middle of the field, is that going to break the imersion? Are we okay with that cost? 
  - How big are these rooms. We want them to be big enough for strategic play, especially if each one is self-contained. That said, that becomes a difficult balancing act. As these going to be dynamically generated rooms, or are they going to be carefully designed?

Discussion: [Cam 3/06/13] I'm willing to accept a few hiccups in terms of entity placement on reloading a room so long as the overall effect is one of gradual, persistent change. Depending on implementation, it might be possible to store entity locations for the most recent room loaded, so if a player runs through a door and runs back through it immediately afterward there's no hiccup. I can't see anything more persistent than that becoming necessary, and even that is negligible. We are all used to enemies simply respawning on entering and exiting a room, as a convention.

[Cam 3/06/13] Yes, flora and fauna should be able to move between rooms, but I think we can find a compromise. I like that hook you proposed; perhaps we can implement it in terms of the entity ai itself? I.e., if a predator is stalking the player, and is within a certain distance when the player exits the room by a sufficiently large door (but does not seal the door shut behind them), after a certain time the new room will spawn that predator at the door, and the prior room's predator population would decrement. This could play into the idea we discussed earlier, about certain entities having access to certain passages. Could we perhaps treat each room as a node, with specific other rooms connected to it, with each connection having a particular "strength" or probability of allowing entities through?

[Cam 3/06/13] Dynamically generated would be conceptually cool, but frankly is too much back-end work and probably edging into too much front-end calculation. Creating the dynamic environment and making it behave well is likely challenging enough. Besides, desinging the rooms ourselves gives us more control over traversal challenges.

Inverted Player Empowerment - 3/06/2013

The notion here is to invert the usual trope of increasing player "power," e.g. new abilities that shortcut former problems and, conversely, increasing the power of enemies to provide challenge. Instead, the player avatar begins the game decently well equipped, but gradually loses abilities and shortcuts, or runs out of limited resources, supplanting them with skills and strategies learned by the player over the course of play. The challenges posed by the environment, after an initial ramp-up, remain fundamentally the same, allowing challenge to evolve organically.

A trivial example: the player begins with a suit and breathing mask that allows her to traverse fungal growth without taking damage. Eventually, the fungus dissolves a seal which cannot be repaired, and the player takes damage while traversing fungal territory.
